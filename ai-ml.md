2. Ask ChatGPT:

"Act as an expert AI mentor. I am a beginner-to-intermediate Python programmer and I want to learn Python specifically for machine learning and AI through real-world, hands-on projects and experience-based learning.

Give me:
	•	A progressive learning path broken into beginner, intermediate, and advanced phases
	•	A list of 3–5 projects for each phase that teach me key skills (e.g. NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, data preprocessing, model evaluation, etc.)
	•	For each project: a short description, what I’ll learn, and how it connects to real ML/AI work
	•	Optional: links to high-quality tutorials, open datasets, or starter code

Keep it focused on learning by doing, not just reading theory. Also include tips on how to document my projects so I can add them to a GitHub portfolio."
